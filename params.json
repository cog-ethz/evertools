  "body": "### Welcome to EVE R Tools.\r\nThe _evertools_-package is meant to be used in tandem with the soon to be released EVE framework. The package's purpose is to wrap access to our database into simpler R-calls and provide some basic statistical analysis over data points in the database. \r\n\r\nYou can download the source code here or use R's devtools to get evertools into your R-distribution and work with it.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install evertools, you need to have devtools installed in your R-distribution. Then the command\r\n\r\n`devtools::install_github(\"cog-ethz/evertools\")`\r\n\r\nwill download an install the package for you and you can access it by adding \r\n\r\n`library(evertools)`\r\n\r\nto you R-script.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe package is mainly developed to expose statistical evaluation to our Unity-based experiment framework EVE. While we use RDotNet to load these R-scripts into the C-sharp environment and will make mostly use of features in the package, we will allow others to load their own R-scripts to enable more complex evaluations within our framework. Or if you prefer to work in the R-environment, you can use evertools to access the database and then proceed in R.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently, the package is created and maintained by Jascha Gr√ºbel (@jugdemon).\r\n",
